Hello! This is a little project I made for myself a while back but decided to spruce up a little and release publicly for students to test with and/or copy code from. 

Got the idea after noticing a few platforming based projects where the movements were just... well, really quite poor and annoying to use which distracted from the primary purpose of the game which often wasnt the platforming itself.

I want this tool to help those that don't want to care about coding to copy from to have nice movement in your game while you focus on what's more important to you! 

This github repo currently holds both the unbuilt game files so everything is fully exposed, as well as the built .exe in case you want to play it on your own pc. The main important script would be the MovementScript.gd as that's where all the movement code is stored.

There's also the built version of the game available on itch.io here - https://calamiturge.itch.io/platformer-tester

If you have any questions or need any help, feel free to contact me on discord (id is calamiturge)

If you want different maps or features / modify some values I don't let you, feel free to ask me, but I recommend having a look at the Godot game engine to maybe modify the project yourself / build additional maps to test yourself, it's pretty easy and the engine is very lightweight / runnable on old dinky laptops.

Best,

Note - the .exe likes to hang for like 15s on first run, I assume it's setting up files or something unsure
